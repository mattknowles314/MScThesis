\section{Meta-Analysis and Network Meta-Analysis}
Meta-Analysis (MA) is a statistical technique for synthesising evidence from similar studies to obtain a quantitative overview of the effectiveness of multiple treatments. The first MA was published by~\cite{smith1977}, concerning psychotherapy outcomes. The disadvantage with MAs is that it can only make pairwise comparisons of interventions compared in head-to-head (HtH) trials. A Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) extends the idea of standard MAs by allowing a comparison to be made between multiple treatments by combining both direct and indirect evidence. Standard NMAs rely on the assumption that any treatment effect modifying (TEM) covariates are balanced across the populations of the included trials. This assumption can be relaxed if individual patient-level data (IPD) is available for every study in the network, in which case a Network Meta-Regression (NMR) model can be used to adjust for any TEMs. \\

It is often the case in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) submissions that IPD is only available for a company's own trial, and aggregate data (AgD) is avaialable for the remaining studies. An IPD NMR is therefore not possible in this situation. Multilevel Network Meta-Regression (ML-NMR) relaxes the requirement for IPD to be present for every study by defining an individual-regression model for the IPD and then fitting the AgD by integrating over the covariate distribution to obtain an aggregate likelihood. This enables IPD and AgD to be combined in one network, and accurately adjusting for differing populations. ML-NMR is a relatively new method, first outlined in~\cite{phillippo2020}, and recently shown to extend easily to survival outcomes~\cite{phillippo2024}. \\

As ML-NMR, particularly for survival outcomes, is a relatively new method for conducting an NMA, there is still some room for investigation on the application of this method. 

\section{Project Aim}\label{sec:aims}
As an ML-NMR has not previously been used to conduct an NMA in pancreatic cancer, the primary objective was to assess the comparative efficacy of treatments for locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer using through an ML-NMR. The outcome of interest was Overall Survival (OS). The focus of this project was not on a comprehensive assessment of the treatment landscape, but on the application of this method, inclusion criteria for the included studies were not particularly strict. Studies had to be a phase II or phase III trial, and contain published Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves with numbers at risk. In addition, studies had to report the proportion of male patients on each treatment arm. \\

The secondary objective was to corroborate the findings of current guidance and publihsed literature (see Chapter~\ref{litChap}). In particular, NICE TA476~\cite{TA476} described some uncertainty in the comparison between GEM-NAB and GEM-CAP, so this NMA also aimed to provide some clarification on the pairwise efficacy of GEM-NAB and GEM-CAP. \\

The final objective of this dissertation was to provide some more insight on the use of ML-NMR in the common HTA scenario of having one IPD study and several AgD studies. By performing two sensitivity analyses (SAs), some insight could be gained on the method itself. 

\section{Pancreatic Cancer}
Pancreatic cancer is the $10^{th}$ most common cancer in the UK, accounting for around $3\%$ of cancer cases in the UK~\cite{pancStat}. Pancreatic cancer is associcated with a particularly poor prognosis. In 2017-2019, there were 9,558 deaths from 10,786 cases. 9663 of these cases were in England and Wales, 856 and 267 were in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. The percentage of pancreatic cancer cases of all cancer cases ranged from between $2.53\%$ in Scotland to $2.84\%$ in England. The poor prognosis is clear from the long-term survival statistics. Approximately $3\%$ of patients survive pancreatic cancer for more than five years~\cite{NG85}.\\

Part of the reason for the poor prognosis is that pancreatic cancer is hard to detect at early stages, meaning most people who present with symptoms already have advanced-stage pancreatic cancer by the time they present. Often, patients only notice symptoms when the tumour has spread to surrounding tissues, or metastises to other organs~\cite{kelsen}. The liver is the most common site of pancreatic cancer metastases~\cite{deeb}. Common symptoms of pancreatic cancer include indigestion, stomach or back pain, loss of appeteite and jauncdice~\cite{pancSymp}. These symtoms are common in other illnesses, which contributes to patients overlooking the fact their symptoms are consistent with pancreatic cancer. \\

Risk factors of pancreatic cancer include smoking, diabetes, obesity, and high-fat diets. Smoking is the dominant risk factor, with around $20\%$ of cases being caused by cigarette smoking. In addition, cancers from smokers contain more genetic mutations when compared to cancers from non-smokers~\cite{blackford}. An older paper publihsed in 1999 identified that roughly $25\%$ of patients have symptoms compatible with upper abdominable disease up to six months prior to diagnoses. When these patients present with such symptoms, the symptoms were erroniously attributed to problems such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)~\cite{dimagno}. This is of course a problem that contributes to the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. The authors suggest that screening of overweight personns with newly-diagnosed diabetes may result in earlier diagnoses of asymptomatic pancreatic cancer. It is likely that at this stage the cancer would be resectable. This is important because the same study suggested that the five-year survival is between $20\%-30\%$ for patients with a resectable tumour that is smaller than $2cm$. Of course, this information is now over 20 years old, so some of the statistics may be outdated, but the issue of the late diagnoses is still relevant today. \\

Around 90\% of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic adenocarcinomas~\cite{pishvaian}. An adenocarcinoma is characterised by excessive growth of epithelial tissue. These cancers often begin in the exocrine component of the pancreas, made up of the head and tail of the pancreas. The exocrine component is primarily responsible for producing digestive enzymes and bicarbonate and carrying them away from the pancreas. Further, these adenocarcinomas begin in the ducts, and are known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDACs)~\cite{neoptolemos}. \\

Figure~\ref{pancInc} presents the incidence of pancreatic cancer in the UK by sex from 1993 to 2018. The incidence rates were relatively flat until the early 2000s, at which point incidence began to increase. In the 2011-2018, the overall incidence (red line) plateaued and began to drop slightly, primarily driven by a declining incidence of pancreatic cancer in females from around 2013. The incidence has continued to rise in males in this time period. Some of this increase in icidence can be accounted for by advances in diagnostic technologies, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans and Endoscopic Ultrasounds (EUS), which are now becoming more routine and readily available. \\

\section{Treatment Landscape}
Gemcitabine (GEM) ($C_9H_{11}F_2N_3O_4$) is a standard first-line treatment for pancreatic\\ cancer~\cite{TA25}. GEM is also used to treat other types of cancer, including breast cancer, bladder cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer~\cite{wong2009}. GEM can be administered alone or in combination with another medication. GEM is generally well tolerated by most patients, but can of course lead to fatal complications~\cite{hryciuk}.  \\

This dissertation considered six treatments that were given in combination with GEM: capecitabine (CAP) ($C_{15}H_{22}FN_3O_6$), axitinib (AXI) ($C_{22}H_{18}N_4OS$), pemetrexed (PEM) ($C_{20}H_{21}N_5O_6$), sorafenib (SOR) ($C_{21}H_{16}CIF_{3}N_4O_3)$, nab-paclitaxel (NAB)\footnote{As nab-paclitaxel is a mixture of paclitaxel ($C_{47}H_{51}NO_{14}$) with albumin protein, it does not have a standard chemical formula} and irinotecan (IRI) ($C_{33}H_{38}N_4O_6$). In addition, one standalone treatment, FOLFIRINOX (FOL), was included. FOL is a combination of oxaliplatin ($C_{8}H_{14}N_{2}O_{4}Pt$), leucovorin ($C_{20}H_{23}N_{7}O_{7}$), fluorouracil ($C_{4}H_{3}FN_{2}O_{2}$), and IRI, which is currently the recommended first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer in the UK. GEM-NAB is currently recommended as an option for treating previously untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma only if other combination chemotherapies are unsuitable, meaning the patient would normally recieve GEM monotherapy.\\

The National Insitute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) last updated their guidance on the digangosis and management of pancreatic cancer in 2018~\cite{NG85}. The guidance for treatment is split for patients with locally advanced cancer and metastatic cancer. 

\subsection{Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer}
Systemic combination chemotherapy is offered to patients who are well enough to tolerate it. For those who are not well enough to tolerate combination therapy, GEM monotherapy is offered. CAP should be considered as the radiosensitiser\footnote{A radiosensitiser is a treatment that makes cancer cells more susceptible to radiotherapy}.

\subsection{Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer}
In first-line treatment, if a patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of $0$ to $1$ and is well enough, they are offered FOL. If the patient is not well enough to tolerate FOL, then GEM combination therapy is offered. Further, if the patient is not well enough to tolerate GEM combination therapy, then GEM monotherapy is offered.  \\

In second-line treatment, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is offered to patients who did not recieve first-line oxaliplatin. GEM combination therapy is offered in the second-line treatment case for patients who progressed after first-line FOL.

\section{Dissertation Structure}
Chapter~\ref{survchap} outlines some concepts in survival analysis that are important to this dissertation. The survival and hazard functions are introduced along with key metrics used for comparing the survival of different treatments. In particular, the median survival time and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) are introduced. The KM estimator is derived using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and an algorithm for reconstructing patient-level data from KM curves is presented. There is some discussion on parametric survival models, which the later chapters rely on. The process by which these models are fit is outlined along with the relevant R packages for doing so. Fianlly, the selection criteria for survival models are explored.\\

Chapter~\ref{nmatheory} discusses the theory of NMAs. First, the idea of a network of evidence is outlined using graph theory. The standard NMA model is then discussed, looking at the relative effect of treatments in a network of evidence. The notion of different types of effects NMAs are introduced, and some discussion on types of variables considered in NMAs is presented. This is then expanded on to derive the ML-NMR model for general likelihoods, which is in turn expanded on to describe the ML-NMR model for survival outcomes. There is some discussion of the numerical integration techniques used when implementing the survival ML-NMR model. Following this, the outcome measures are introduced in the ML-NMR context, building on the initial definitions in Chapter~\ref{survchap}. Finally, the model selection criteria and metrics are introduced. \\

Chapter~\ref{trialschap} presents the clinical trials that were included in the NMA. A summary table presents the treatments, number of patients, and summary covariate information in each trial. There is some discussion on the similarity of the studies based on the data in the table. The discussion of similarity is aided by two forest plots presenting the variation of the median OS in each study. The KM curves for each study are also presented. Finally, the extrapolation plots of the parametric models fit to each treatment arm of each study are presented. The models are discussed to inform which survival models would be used in the NMA. \\

Chapter~\ref{litChap} presents the (relevant) findings of several NMAs in pancreatic cancer. This is primarily used for validation of the results of this NMA. Some discussion is given to the findings of the literature, and where this NMA stands within that wider context. \\

Chapter~\ref{nmachap} presents the NMA itself. For the base case and two SAs, the network of evidence is presented along with some discussion. The model fitting and selection is then presented, with discussion on which model provided the best fit and was therefore selected. A table presenting the information criterion scores for each model is used to compare each model. The results of the ML-NMR are then presented. Simulated KM curves of each treatment in two study populations are presented. Further to this, forest plots of RMST and median OS for each treatment in each population are presented. Ppairwise comparisons of each treatment are used to assess treatments with significant differences. Finally, cumulative rank probabilities are presented to determine the ranking of treatments.  
In addition, there is some discussion on how this NMA aligns with the good practice framework laid out by The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).\\

Chapter~\ref{conclusions} discusses the results of Chapter~\ref{nmachap} and the interpretation thereof. The aims presented in Section~\ref{sec:aims} are adressed before some more general discussion and comments on potential future work. \\

Appendix~\ref{NMAAppendix} presents some additional results from the NMA that were not required for drawing any conclusions, but may be of value to the interested reader. Appendix~\ref{isporqs} details the individaul ISPOR good practice questions, and the answers to them in the context of this NMA. Appendix~\ref{pack} outlines the development of the \verb|PCNMA| R package that was ysed for conducting this NMA. While not relevant to understanding any of the results, this appendix may be interesting to the more programming-minded reader.
