\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Pancreatic Cancer}
Pancreatic cancer is the $10^{th}$ most common cancer in the UK, accounting for $3\%$ of all new cases~\cite{pancStat}. Pancreatic cancer has a particularly poor prognosis. In 2016-2018, there were 9,558 deaths from 10,452 cases. Pancreatic cancer is hard to detect at early stages, meaning most people who present with symptoms already have advanced-stage pancreatic cancer. Often, patients only notice symptoms when the tumour has spread to surrounding tissues, or metastises to other organs~\cite{kelsen}. The liver is the most common site of pancreatic cancer metastases~\cite{deeb}. Common symptoms of pancreatic cancer include indigestion, stomach or back pain, loss of appeteite and jauncdice~\cite{pancSymp}. \\

Risk factors of pancreatic cancer include smoking, diabetes, obesity, and high-fat diets. Smoking is the dominant cause, with around $20\%$ of cases being caused by cigarette smoking. In addition, cancers from smokers contain more genetic mutations when compared to cancers from non-smokers~\cite{blackford}. 

\section{Treatment Landscape}
Gemcitabine (GEM) ($C_9H_{11}F_2N_3O_4$) is a standard first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer administered intrveneously~\cite{NG85}. GEM is also used to treat other types of cancer, including breast cancer, bladder cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer~\cite{wong2009}. GEM can be administered alone or in combination with another medication.
