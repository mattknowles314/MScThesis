\section{Conclusion}
GEM-NAB and GEM-CAP offer a better alternative to GEM monotherapy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer in terms of median OS and RMST. GEM-AXI and GEM-PEM do not significantly improve median OS or RMST compared to GEM monotherapy, and GEM-IRI and GEM-SOR both give worse median OS and RMST compared to GEM alone. 

\section{Discussion and Further Work}
The ML-NMR framework is ideal for working with a combination of both IPD and AgD. Unfortunately, no IPD could be obtained for this dissertation, but would lead to interesting future work. \\

The results obtained in this dissertation align with an NMA conducted by~\cite{gresham2014}, which also found GEM-NAB and GEM-CAP offered improvements in OS compared to GEM monotherapy. This NMA included fewer studies than that of~\cite{gresham2014}, so future work to expand the number of trials would be good to solidfy the place of GEM-NAB and GEM-CAP as the best treatment options for advanced/pancreatic cancer. \\

Given the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer, even a small improvement in median OS of a couple of months is of immense emotional value to patients and their families, and should not be overlooked for looking like small improvements out of context.
