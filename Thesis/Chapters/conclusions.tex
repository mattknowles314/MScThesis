\section{Conclusion}

\section{Discussion and Further Work}
The results obtained in this dissertation align with an NMA conducted by~\cite{gresham2014}, which also found GEM-NAB and GEM-CAP offered improvements in OS compared to GEM monotherapy. This NMA included fewer studies than that of~\cite{gresham2014}, so future work to expand the number of trials would be good to solidfy the place of GEM-NAB and GEM-CAP as the best treatment options for advanced/pancreatic cancer. \\

In 2017, NICE published TA476~\cite{TA476}, which recommended GEM-NAB as an option for untreated metastatic pancratic cancer in adults only if other combination chemotherapies are unsuitable and the patient would otherwise recieve GEM monotherapy. The TA claimed that GEM-NAB was more effective in increasing than GEM monotherapy, similarly effctive to GEM-CAP, but was less effective than FOLFIRINOX. The comparison to GEM-CAP was stated as ``uncertain''.


Given the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer, even a small improvement in median OS of a couple of months is of immense emotional value to patients and their families, and should not be overlooked for looking like small improvements out of context.
